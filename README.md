### Extracting, visualizing and analyzing pollen concentration
Monitoring pollen concentrations is essential for public health, enabling individuals—especially those with allergies or asthma—to minimize exposure and manage symptoms effectively.   

The objective of this hackathon is to develop an R package for downloading, visualizing and analyzing data on pollen concentration in Switzerland.

The expected functionalities of the R package are:
 1. Download pollen data from API.
 2. Prepare data internally for mapping and analyzing.
 3. Generate high quality maps of Switzerland with the pollen concentration by city or by canton
