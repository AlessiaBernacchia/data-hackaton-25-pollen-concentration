\usage{
plot_specific_pollen(
  polline_df,
  pollen_type = "grass",
  PATH_map = "2025_GEOM_TK"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{polline_df}{A data frame containing pollen concentration data, including canton names
and numeric columns for each pollen type (e.g., grass_pollin, tree_pollin, etc.).}

\item{pollen_type}{Character string indicating the type of pollen to visualize.
Must correspond to a column prefix in polline_df (e.g., "grass", "tree", or "weed").}

\item{PATH_map}{path for map directory}
}
\value{
plot of most prominent pollin on the swiss map
}
\description{
This function takes a data frame with pollen concentration data and generates
a thematic map of Switzerland, showing the average concentration of a specific
pollen type (tree, weed, or grass) across cantons. It overlays the pollen data
on top of canton shapefiles and lakes for context.
